# ReekyMarko's dotfiles
![screenshot of my setup](https://i.imgur.com/lz1Q4Zz.png?raw=true")

My personal dotfiles for my workstations, mostly for easy access for myself
but feel free to steal them for yourself!

I'm using [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop) to manage and ease deployment of my dotfiles.
