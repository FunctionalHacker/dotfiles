= FunctionalVim

This is my personal NeoVim configuration I use for all text editing in my free
time and at my day job. I mostly code in Java, TypeScript and ReactJS, with
a bit of Rust and Python once in a blue moon.

The configuration is quite minimal but still fully featured. Some highlights
include

* LSP support with neovim's built in LSP client
** LSP servers are easily installed and auto-configured with Mason
* Treesitter
** Code folding
** Code highlighting
** Text objects
* Lazy plugin manager for fast startup times

This configuration is not ment to be a NeoVim distro, so it can be a bit opinionated.
Feel free to steal the configuration and use as the https://git.korhonen.cc/FunctionalHacker/dotfiles/src/branch/main/LICENSE.adoc[license]
allows.
